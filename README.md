# Let's Make A Game

Need something to do while you're stuck at home because of the coronavirus? How about helping to make a game? If that sounds fun, join up and we'll get busy!

## Rough Ideas To Get Started

### Setting
Think Ancient Rome (myths and all) with a color palette I can only describe as “late afternoon in Breath of the Wild.” If e we go 3D then we can explore a cel shaded style. Otherwise lean into a Samurai Jack aesthetic. 

### Characters
#### Mom
- 30ish
- Named Dia
#### Daughter
- 8-10
- Named Esta 
#### Son
- 1ish
- Named Quil 
#### Spouse
#### Owl
- Close by at night
- Maybe an incarnation of the spouse?
#### NPC Helper
- Looks like Wizardmon grew up in the woods
#### Big Bad
- Has a cloak that looks like swirling black water

### Gameplay
You make camp every night. Sometimes there’s a fire, sometimes you're huddled under shelter when it rains. Each time there’s a small bit of conversation or moment shared between the family members. 

The owl is always around at night. Possibly you can interact with it to save the game. Either that or autosave each night. Story could be on rails with days being individual levels or open world exploration. Depends on how many nightly events we can come up with. 

Time passes throughout the game. I’m thinking it will occur over about ten years. All three characters will be playable somehow at some point. The mother will initially be the most skillful character but her abilities will degrade over time. The daughter will become the most useful towards the end of the game. The son will go from “needing protection 24/7” to “helpful but unreliable” and then to the level that the daughter starts at. Puzzles/battles will need the contribution of all the characters in one way or another. 

### Story
#### The Beginning
You just got the kids to sleep and you’re adjusting a small shrine you have to your deity. It has a little crystal that starts shining when you adjust it correctly. There’s a sudden, loud thud on the door. Spouse opens the door and tells you to run. You grab the kids, and run to the bank door. You glance man to see spouse and intruder(s) fighting and you see them get hurt (badly) just before you make it out the back. You make it out of town and turn to see a plume of smoke begin to rise. 

You’re on your way somewhere far. Possibly a temple to the deity from your altar. Wherever you’re going, you need help to save or revive your spouse. 

#### Events In No Particular Order
At one point you come around a corner/over a hill/out of a cave and see gigantic Romanesque ruins.

Giant spider battle/chase. 

Daughter falls down a crack in the earth. Party is split and she has to look for a way out while mom and son look for a way to help. 

#### The End
The sky is red, orange, and purple with a single wavy line of light all the way across. The line opens up and a hand of light comes out. The hand grabs the earth and pulls spouse out alive. 

### Random Thoughts
What is/are the Vorah? What is/are the Vor?
