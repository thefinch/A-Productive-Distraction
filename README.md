# Diary of Dia

We're here to build a game together. This game is as much for fun as it is for catharsis. It is our hope that this project can bring us together even if it's only virtually.

To get up to speed:
- Check out the [original idea](https://github.com/thefinch/Diary-of-Dia/blob/master/docs/original-idea.md)
- Read through the [script](https://github.com/thefinch/Diary-of-Dia/blob/master/docs/script.pdf)
- Read the [Game Design Document](https://github.com/thefinch/Diary-of-Dia/blob/master/docs/game-design-document.md)

Whatever your skillset, we can find a way for you to help.

When you're ready, join us on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/kxsF4v8) to get started!
