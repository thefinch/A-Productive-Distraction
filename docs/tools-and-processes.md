> As far as character creation and world building, I generally think of certain psychological traits/motifs as well as adjectives to flesh out alongside certain traits. If we're talking an evil character that is unknown, I would tap into esotericism and almost alien features hence the floating shards and otherworldly shapes for Covax and his companions.

> The world goes alongside the characters often for me in description. Soft characters reside in soft worlds like inner-city or countryside Rome for example. Dia's warrior days are behind her with children in the picture, and Vorus is the embodiment of the wholesome guy who is only allowed to be wholesome because reasonable laws allow him and those like him to be. The days of being rough have been refined over the centuries of introducing consideration and losing the former tough forms of government necessary to the nation's beginnings. This is all very much in line with Roman/Greek rise and decline, except I've brought Covax in as this ancient anti-establishment destroyer who embodies the primordial past's alien predatory line of thought.

> How do I come up with all this? I really can't even answer that. Like many writers I have the spark of imagination and then a huge background in history and context, philosophy, etc. I create original works by doing this thing where I base a lot of the events on ones that have happened in the past that I've read, or things I have witnessed personally like the love of family and dutiful partnership ideals etc. I use FinalDraft to create my screenplays.
