# Game Design Document

This document will be the blueprint from which the game is built. Every single detail necessary to build the game will be addressed here. Be as descriptive as possible. Think bigger than what you are able to develop then write it all down.

## 1.  Title Page

### 1.1.    Game Name – Perhaps also add a subtitle or high concept sentence.
TBA
A family unfairly split must grow together to overcome everything and once again become whole.

## 2.  Game Overview

### 2.1.    Game Concept
A wife loses her soulmate. A daughter and son lose their parent. They all lose their home. They are now on the run and searching for a way to bring their family back together.

### 2.2.    Genre
Action/adventure/puzzle. There will be combat. There will be exploration. There will be obstacles that need to be resolved. Preferably there will be multiple solutions to problems, depending on the abilities that each character has.

### 2.3.    Target Audience
Mainly adults and that is not because there will be adult only content in the game. In fact, I'd like to steer away from that if possible simple because it earns an automatic no from a large group of players. The target is adults mainly because the emotional content of the story will only really resonate with those that have encountered loss as well as togetherness in times of hardship.

### 2.4.    Game Flow Summary – How does the player move through the game.   Both through framing interface and the game itself.
The player moves through the game in two main modes:
1) Controlling one or more of the main characters at once to fight, solve a puzzle, or search the environment. Possible modes would be switching through one character at a time and letting AI take care of the others or by using differnt inputs to control each character. The second option is markedly more difficult for the player, but it could be used to reinforce the difficulties faced by the mother caused by raising two children not only by herself but while also on the run.
2) The second mode is mainly passive conversation or cutscenes used between the times when the first mode is used. This will normally be through setting up camp and what happens throughout the night. There may be choices to be made here. No idea yet on whether choices will impact the game much or not.

### 2.5.    Look and Feel – What is the basic look and feel of the game?  What is the visual style?
The look can be described as a "late afternoon Breath of the Wild" color scheme with the smooth movement and sharp contrasts of Samurai Jack.

## 3.  Gameplay and  Mechanics

### 3.1.    Gameplay
The main mode of active player interaction with the game will consist of:
- An as of yet undetermined number of setpiece battles with monsters or people as the circumstances would have them. There will likely be some unique mechanics per battle (ex. climb to higher ground if you're fighting a giant cyclops).
- Finding particular people/items. These should be deduced from hints dropped throughout the game. The end goal is likely to appease a diety in some way and part of that process will probably involve needing to collect precious items. I hate fetch quests so preferably the items will have a more tangible effect. They could possibly grant some new abilities or unlock new areas. Just...no "go collect 10 boar skins" "thanks, here's your gold" please. If we're collecting boar skins then we better be putting them to use. Maybe they're used to create warmer clothes so we can go explore a colder climate. Everything has a purpose. Chekhov's gun and all that.

#### 4.2.2.  Areas, including the general description and physical characteristics as well as how it relates to the rest of the world (what levels use it, how it connects to other areas)

### 4.3.    Characters.  Each character should include the back story, personality, appearance, animations, abilities, relevance to the story and relationship to other characters

## 5.  Levels

### 5.1.    Levels.  Each level should include a synopsis, the required introductory material (and how it is provided), the objectives, and the details of what happens in the level.  Depending on the game, this may include the physical description of the map, the critical path that the player needs to take, and what encounters are important or incidental.

### 5.2.    Training Level

### 6.3.    Audio, music, sound effects

### 6.4.    Help System
